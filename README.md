## Summary

This project was to learn about API using the API from openweathermap.org, alongside with API, I have learned about promises and async/await. This is a simple weather app to show real-time weather in any particular city.
I have also utilised webpack and import the package 'moment' to get the current date.

### Features
Search field to search for particular city in any country.
Extra information about: Humidity, Feel-like temperature, wind speed, highest and lowest temperature in the day.
Toggle button to change from Celcius degree to Fahrenheit degree.

There are 5-day forecast feature that I want to add when I feel more comfortable with API and with CSS frameworks to make things display more neatly.
